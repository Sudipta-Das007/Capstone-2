Image Captioning with Docker:
This project provides a Docker-based solution for image captioning, a task that involves generating descriptive captions for images.
With Docker, you can easily set up and run the image captioning model, making it a portable and reproducible solution for generating captions for your images.
This app also includes integration with Jenkins. 
Jenkins is a software used to automate the process so instead of running commands manually it run them automatically.
Sending mail to every team member on each build failure and build success is integrated and working fine.
